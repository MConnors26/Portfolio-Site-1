                <p>In late 2024 I completed an associate's degree in computer science with a focus
                    on software development from Connecticut State Community College. My journey focused 
                    on backend development languages, frontend development languages, and how these two ends
                    can work simultaneously to create the overall user experience.

                <p>A member of the class of 2009, I earned a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication. I was originally
                    a computer science major but, at the time, found myself more interested in photojournalism. I became the 
                    cheif photographer for the school newspaper and covered a wide range of events from campus talks to the men's 
                    hockey team winning the regional championship.
                </p>
                <p>I also worked as the online editor for the school newspaper and regularly updated and maintained the paper's 
                    website through Adobe Dreamweaver. This included constructing custom photo galleries and communicating updates
                    to the entire campus body.
